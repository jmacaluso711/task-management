## Notes

- I chose to keep my focus on the front end.
- Styling is done with `styled-components` for modularity.
- Using `react-flip-move` for transitions.
- The state is being saved in localStorage for the sake of this exercise.

I look forward to hearing any feedback! Let me know if you have any trouble getting the repo up an running.
