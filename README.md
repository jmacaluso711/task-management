# IBM Sample Application

Thank you for the opportunity to complete the tech assessment. I had a lot of fun with it!

## Quick Start

```
  1. clone this repo
  2. cd into task-management
  2. npm install
  3. npm start
```

The site will open at `localhost:3000`.

## Notes

- I chose to keep my focus on the front end.
- Styling is done with `styled-components` for modularity.
- Using `react-flip-move` for transitions.
- The state is being saved in localStorage for the sake of this exercise.

I look forward to hearing any feedback! Let me know if you have any trouble getting the repo up an running.
